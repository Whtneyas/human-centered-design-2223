# Human Centered Design ‚úçÔ∏è

## What is the Project? 
For this project we have to design for one specific person with a disability. The purpose of this project is to get deeper into the users and to learn how to test your designs. To test how your  well your specific person can use your design or product. I can achieve a better design  by prototyping and testing my design with this specific person.  


## Tester for my design:üßë‚Äçüíª

The tester for my design is Nicollette Besemer 

### About Nicollete Besemerüë©


Nicolette has limited use of her limbs. She uses a wheelchair to move around, and on her computer, she uses speech software and a drawing tablet instead of a mouse. This makes navigation difficult because she cannot use shortcuts. Nicolette is very involved in accessibility. In addition, she organizes a lot for the neighborhood and other volunteers. She used to be a geologist by profession and enjoys visiting natural wonders. She is also passionate about nature.


### Problem: Copy and paste Pasting‚úÇÔ∏èüìú
For her work, Nicolette reads and shares a lot of text pieces on, among other places, the website of the municipality. It is important to be able to extract the correct pieces and forward them. Without the right-click or shortcut keys, it is almost impossible to cut and paste. Design a way to navigate, select, cut, and paste text using speech and a drawing tablet.


### Questions for Nicollette Besemer‚ùî‚ùî
I sat with my group who also are to design for Nicollete to brainstorm on what ewe can do for Nicollette and also came up with questions we can ask Nicolletete during the interview so that we get a grasp of what we need to include in the deisgn and what not. 

1. What type of tablet are you currently using? 
1. After testing the product that we have made. What went well and what went bad. 
2. Why are you using a tablet and not a mouse? 
4. What are you able to do and what can't you do? 
5. Wat voor hinder heb je? 
6. What type of files and apps do you use
7. Hoe gebruik je spraak op dit moment? 
8. Er bestaat er alkopieer en plakken op tekentabletten. How werkt het bij u? 
9. Waarom is er voor spraak gekoze? 
10. 

### Possible solutions

So before i test my design with Nicollette i thooght of some possible solutions to this problem. 

- **Navigating- Voice command** üß≠

 For navigating on the website the user can use voice commands to navigate through the text.For example, say "scroll up" or "scroll down" to  move through the document.


- **Selecting** 

  Use the drawing tablet to select text. Draw a circle around the text you want to select, and then say "select" or "highlight." The selected text will be highlighted on the screen.

- **Cutting**
 
 Draw a line through the selected text using the drawing tablet, and then say "cut" or "delete." The selected text will be removed from the document.

 - **Pasting**
  
 Move the cursor to the location where you want to paste the text, and then say "paste." The text you cut earlier will be inserted at the cursor location.



## Exclusive design principles üñ•Ô∏è
Exclusive designs are principles implemented when designing for people who are not mostly included when making designs example peopele with disabilitie. 



## Trials 

### Clipboard 
 i  tried using the Clipboard api to try copying and pasting but unfortunately it didnt work cos the cliip api doesn't work old all browser and older browsers. I tried to experiment first in codepen before i work on it in Vscode:

## Testing 

  ###  Test 1 
  I made a simple web page with some design features to see how the user selects, copies and pastes text on their tablet, as I didn't know what kind of tablet they use or how they use it. I chose to make a nature-themed website because the user likes nature according to the project documentation, hoping that it would be more interesting and enjoyable for them.

 ### Testing with a tablet

I decided to borrow a tablet from my friend to test it myself since I haven't met Nicollette yet. I realized that selecting text with the tablet was annoying and didn't go as fast as I wanted it to. I also realized that I could only select one word but not a sentence. Additionally, I had to tap on the text with the pen two to three times before I could select a text.

## Testing with Nicollette. 
My team and i first had a discussion with her about the project and proceeded with asking the questions we prepared to ask her. One of the team member also brought a drawingtablet so that nicollette can test on it. 

### Answers for the questions


1. What type of tablet are you currently using? 

Answer: Nicollette didn't really remember the type of drawing tablet she has. So we had to mention the different brands of drawing tablets and finally got to know that she using **Wacom Tablet**


1. After testing the product that we have made. What went well and what went bad. 

 Answer: She didn't like the fact that she has to click on a button to activate a speech recognition. She told us about how she puts on a speech recognition. She said she puts it's on in the morning and in the eveing she puts it off. She didn't like the fact that she has to always click a button when she wants to speak in the microfone or give instructions to the microfone.
  

2. Why are you using a tablet and not a mouse?

Answer : She said she cannot work with her nouse at all because it involves scrlling and clicking which she is unfortunately not able to do so uses basically a drawing tablet as a mousE. With the drawing tablet she has to hold the pen without clicking anything with her hands but rather use her pen. On the pen, are two buttons which can be used for selecting a text so she uses that.

4. What are you able to do and what can't you do? 
  
5. Wat voor hinder heb je? 

6. What type of files and apps do you use üóÇÔ∏èüìë

Answer : She said she uses mostly word documents and she also selects folders en place them in other folders. Selcting of folders isn't something she finds difficult but having to select multiple folders and to scroll at the same time is what she finds difficult because she can't hold press the pen for long.

7. How do you currently use the speech recognition? üîä

Answer: She said she uses the speak recognition for almost everything. She uses it for scrolling, for sending text messages ect. For navigation she tries as much as possible to use the mouse. She also finds it uncomfortable to use the speech recognition in public places since it is going to get people's attention making people aorund her and herself feeling uncomfortable

8. Er bestaat er alkopieer en plakken op tekentabletten. How werkt het bij u? 

9. Waarom is er voor spraak gekozen?


### Insights

After lsitening to her and having to make her take the test. I got to know a few things that i can implement in my next prototype

- She loves nature so i think it is advisable to make a website that is about nature 
- She works more with folders so i think making a website that require selecting and replacing folders.
- Copying without scrolling for long.
- She prefers reading in light mode than darkmode.
- She prefers the text being bigger cos she has a bad eye sight.
- Instructing with speech for scrolling left and right.
- Finding an easier way for her not to scroll for long.
- Enlarging the target touch point so that clicking of buttons become easier for her.

### Study Situation
We have to first understand and study people with disabilites.You cannot design for people with disabilities if you don't understand them and try to know the situation they are in. I was able to execute this principle by getting to know Nicollete and talking to her one on one.
I observed how she uses speech recognition for sending messages. Eighty percent of the time Nicollete uses speech recognition for almost all her things when interacting with a device.She also finds it difficult with scrolling for along time. She says sometimes it just doesn't work with scrolling.
