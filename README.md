##  Research question ‚ùì
  > How can Nicollette be able to easily copy and paste text without much difficulty ‚ùî‚ùî


 ## Defining the problem.
Nicolette has limited use of her limbs. She uses a wheelchair to move around, and on her computer, she uses speech software and a drawing tablet instead of a mouse. This makes navigation difficult because she cannot use shortcuts. Nicolette is very involved in accessibility. In addition, she organizes a lot for the neighborhood and other volunteers. She used to be a geologist by profession and enjoys visiting natural wonders. She is also passionate about nature. For her work, Nicolette reads and shares a lot of text pieces on, among other places, the website of the municipality. It is important to be able to extract the correct pieces and forward them. Without the right-click or shortcut keys, it is almost impossible to cut and paste. Nicollette wants a way to navigate, select, cut, and paste text using speech and a drawing tablet. Nicollette also want to be able to scroll through text easily.

## Solution for the problem 
I would like Nicollete to have the ability to select, copy, and paste with just one click. Currently, Nicollete primarily relies on speech recognition, which accounts for approximately 80% of her usage. However, I believe it would be beneficial to introduce a feature that is more advantageous than speech recognition. For instance, when Nicollete is reading books in a library, using speech recognition can prove to be distracting for others. To address this, I have developed buttons that enable Nicollete to effortlessly select, copy, and paste titles, paragraphs, and entire sections with a single click. Moreover, I have incorporated a button that facilitates scrolling, offering a seamless scrolling effect when activated and allowing for quick cessation of scrolling with another click. This solution eliminates the need for Nicollete to perform long presses on the buttons. Instead, she simply presses the scrolling button to initiate scrolling and presses the pause button to stop the scrolling when desired.
