# Human Centered Design

## What is the Project? 
For this project we have to design for one specific person with a disability. The purpose of this project is to get deeper into the users and to learn how to test your designs. To test how your  well your specific person can use your design or product. I can achieve a better design  by prototyping and testing my design with this specific person.  


## Tester for my design 

The tester for my design is Nicollette Besemer 

### About Nicollete Besemer 

Nicolette has limited use of her limbs. She uses a wheelchair to move around, and on her computer, she uses speech software and a drawing tablet instead of a mouse. This makes navigation difficult because she cannot use shortcuts. Nicolette is very involved in accessibility. In addition, she organizes a lot for the neighborhood and other volunteers. She used to be a geologist by profession and enjoys visiting natural wonders. She is also passionate about nature.


### Problem: Copy and paste
For her work, Nicolette reads and shares a lot of text pieces on, among other places, the website of the municipality. It is important to be able to extract the correct pieces and forward them. Without the right-click or shortcut keys, it is almost impossible to cut and paste. Design a way to navigate, select, cut, and paste text using speech and a drawing tablet.
